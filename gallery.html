							This picture shows the capabilities of a steam engine, which is a late
							game mechanism, allowing you to produce up to 294,912 SU in one machine.
							Although this might seem overpowered, it is in fact not as there is a
							lot of hard to get materials that need to be automated in order to keep
							it running, such as blaze cakes.

							This picture shows the far extents of Create Mod, as it even reaches far
							and often untouched parts of automation such as the breeding or handling
							of animals. In this case, the image shows a barn house with cows being
							milked. The source of this image is the Create Mod Trailer World.

							This is a picture from the Create Mod Trailer World that shows a house

						<p>
							This screenshot, once again from the trailer world, depicts a scene of

							This is a screenshot form, once again, you guessed it, the Create Mod
							Trailer World, and it shows the cake, the final product of the world

							create, you can accomplish that goal, and that is the beauty of the mod.
