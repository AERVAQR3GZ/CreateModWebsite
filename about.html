				<p>
					Create mod can be
					<strong class="animateoohyea">played in modpacks</strong>
					or as a single mod, but with the possibilities of the recipes being very
					different between versions or being changed between modpacks, I recommend using
					<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei">
						JEI (Just Enough Items)
					</a>
					or
					<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items">
						REI (Roughly Enough Items)
					</a>
					as they both allow for the quick and easy browsing of items and their recipes,
					as well as allowing you to preview what they do (Which is already part of
					create) without having the item yet (Which was not a part of create). It also
					has an incredible recipe preview menu.

					Create mod has many
					<strong class="animateoohyea">wonderful menus</strong>
					, but one that provials for beginners is the menu for
					<strong class="animateoohyea">explaining specific blocks and machines</strong>
					, defining their purpose and how to use them. To enter it, simply hover over the
					item in your inventory and
					<strong class="animateoohyea">hold "W"</strong>
					or use JEI/REI to search it up and hover over it, holding "W" while doing so
					until the menu pops up. This feature can be used for
					<strong class="animateoohyea">any block</strong>
					in the
					<strong class="animateoohyea">entirety of create</strong>
					, allowing for a
					<strong class="animateoohyea">simple and clean</strong>
					learning curve where you do not have to google videos on certain blocks.

				<h1>
					What are
					<span class="animateoohyea">SU?</span>
				</h1>
				<p>
					Stress units (SU) are a
					<strong class="animateoohyea">measurement of power</strong>
					used for machines. Contrary to popular belief, Stress Units (SU) and Rotations
					Per Minute (RPM)
					<strong class="animateoohyea">are separate</strong>
					, they are two different things. For example, a small and a large waterwheel. A
					small waterwheel spins at 8rpm with 256su, but a large water wheel spins at 4rpm
					at 512su, but
					<strong class="animateoohyea">they are not the same</strong>
					. Stress units are a unit of power that is used to power machines, while
					<strong class="animateoohyea">
						RPM simply changes how fast the machines work.
					</strong>

					<br />
					<br />
					Stress units are used in
					<strong class="animateoohyea">proportion</strong>
					to the
					<strong class="animateoohyea">"Kinetic Stress Impact"</strong>
					. The
					<strong class="iknow-weirdacronim">
						<strong class="animateoohyea">KSI</strong>
					</strong>
					is a measurement of
					<strong class="animateoohyea">how many stress units a machine uses</strong>
					, and can be 2x RPM, 4x RPM and 8x RPM. This number is know as
					<strong class="animateoohyea">the impact value</strong>
					. An impact value of 2x RPM such as an encased fan, will use 2x stress units
					equal to 2x the input RPM. For example, A mechanical drill which operates at 4x
					RPM put onto a system with 64 RPM would use 256 stress units as 64 x 4 is 256.

				<h1>What is RPM?</h1>
				<p>
					RPM, Unlike Stress Units, which are completely separate, are a
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-1">
						measurement of how fast a machine attached to that system will move
					</strong>
					. RPM, unlike Stress Units, can be scaled using things such as gear ratios,
					where a
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-1">
						small and a large cogwheel
					</strong>
					are used in conjunction to
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-1">generate more RPM</strong>
					while keeping the
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-1">same SU</strong>
					, but this can also be done with a
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-1">rotation speed controller</strong>
					. . For example, a small waterwheel produces 256su at 8rpm, and a large water
					wheel produces 512su at 4rpm are not the same, although it might seem like they
					are.
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-1">RPM can always be changed</strong>
					using gear ratios such as the one seen below.

				<h1>How to build with Create</h1>
				<p>
					With create mod, you can
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-2">build anything you want</strong>
					, from an incredible factory to a simple house elevator,
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-2">
						Create Mod really has it all
					</strong>
					. Create mod also has many tools and items that
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-2">make building smooth</strong>
					, such as the
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-2">wrench</strong>
					. The wrench is a tool that is key to almost any playthrough of create, and it
					allows you to
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-2">
						rotate the blocks and machines you place
					</strong>
					that are from create, but it also allows you to
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-2">
						pick up create machinery blocks
					</strong>
					by shift clicking them, allowing for a very quick and clean way to move or
					bulldoze machines.
					<br />
					<br />
					Another create Item that is very useful for building is the
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-2">Toolbox</strong>
					. A toolbox effectively acts as a
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-2">pocket wormhole</strong>
					for
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-2">up to 8 items</strong>
					.
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-2">When nearby</strong>
					a toolbox, a player can press their toolbox keybind: by default, this is 'Left
					Alt' and it will open a somewhat circular menu, with 8 slots
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-2">
						storing a "Large Amount" (Even more than 64!)
					</strong>
					of each item for it to be quickly withdrawn, although the player must have put
					the items in before hand. It can also
					<strong class="animateoohyea-changed-color-2">be picked up</strong>
					, and still retains its contents while in the inventory.

				<h4>About the creators</h4>
				<p>
					I chose to make a website about this for my IST (Computing Technology) class at
					school.
				</p>
				<p>
					This mod is not my original work. This is a Minecraft mod by the creator
					<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/members/simibubi">simibubi</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Huge thankyou too Dejojotheawsome and his content over on
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dejojotheawsome">Youtube</a>
					as his walkthroughs and informative long form content really drove this page to
					have the best information it possibly could have.
